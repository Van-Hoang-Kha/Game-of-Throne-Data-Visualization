# Sound of Fire

An interactive data visualization website for my favorite show, Game of Throne (up until season 8). This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Here's the link to the [Website](https://soundoffire.netlify.com).

# Most challenging parts
- Being able to load and render 3d models properly (learning curve with 'mesh')
- Elements with positions/absolute ruins the rest of the contents. Also depends on the screensizes.
- Mobile friendly interactive charts - this needs to be dynamically changing.

# To-do
1) Preload images when first loading the screens
2) Configurate/Render 3D models better 
3) Look into WebGL/OpenGL
4) Chart sections need to be dynamically changing (depending on screen-sizes)
