# Sound of Fire

An interactive data visualization website for my favorite show, Game of Throne (up until season 8). This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Here's the link to the [Website](https://soundoffire.netlify.com).
General Comment: This website is actually version 2. 
The previous version of this website had a different layout and used GSAP instead of Parallax/Three.js. This project was ultimately 'revamped' for me to test out THREE.js and PARALLAX effects on React. 👏 I'm currently working on 3D Modeling using Blender to add more freatures to this website. 

# Most challenging parts 😓
- Loading and rendering 3d models properly (learning curve with 'mesh')
- Elements with positions/absolute ruins the rest of the contents. Also depends on the screensizes.
- Mobile friendly interactive charts - this needs to be dynamically changing.

# To-do 👍
1) Preload images when first loading the screens
2) Configurate/Render 3D models better 
3) Look into WebGL/OpenGL
4) Chart sections need to be dynamically changing (depending on screen-sizes)
